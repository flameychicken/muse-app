    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: June 1, 2025</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Muse. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
      any information you provide. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle
      data (or, in this case, <strong>do not</strong> handle data) when you use
      our app or visit our website.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Don’t Collect</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Muse does not collect, store, or share any personal information.</strong>
      You can use our app features—including connecting your Spotify or Apple Music accounts,
      scanning or creating MuseTags—without providing any personal data directly
      to us.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No names, email addresses, or phone numbers.</li>
      <li>No precise location data or device identifiers.</li>
      <li>No browsing history or analytics beyond basic server logs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our app integrates with Spotify and Apple Music to allow you to browse and manage your
      playlists. When you connect your Spotify or Apple Music account, you authenticate
      directly with the respective service. Muse does not store your Spotify or Apple Music credentials or
      your personal data from these services. Any calls to their APIs are made using your
      own access tokens, and you can revoke access at any time via your Spotify or Apple Music
      account settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook pixel, or other tracking scripts
      on our website. Basic server logs (e.g., IP address, timestamp, requested
      URL) may be stored by our hosting provider for debugging and maintenance,
      but are not tied back to you personally.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
      We do not utilize cookies or local storage to track you personally. If you
      see any cookie prompts, they are likely from our hosting provider or
      static site generator—they are not used for user tracking, personalization,
      or advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our app and website are not intended for children under 13. We do not
      knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe
      a child under 13 has submitted personal data to us, please contact us, and
      we will promptly delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Although we do not store any personal user data, we employ standard
      security measures (HTTPS/TLS) to protect any communication between your
      device and our servers. Always ensure you are running the latest version
      of the Muse app.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. The “Effective Date” at
      the top will reflect when changes are made. If we make material changes,
      we will post a notice on our homepage
      (<a href="https://muse-app.info/">muse-app.info</a>) or email you if you
      have opted in to communications.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about this policy, please email us at
      <a href="mailto:privacy@muse-app.info">privacy@muse-app.info</a>.
